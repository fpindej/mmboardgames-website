                    Ski jumping is considered the crown discipline of winter sports. 
                    This game is dedicated to all of its fans and passionate followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emotion, thrills, joy and good times await; just as if you were at a real competition. 
                    While playing, you will start training both the physical and mental strength of your jumper. 
                    Conserving your jumperâ€™s energy is an important factor in the contest. 
                    And, of course, you will get to jump from ski ramps with a realistic-looking figure. Players determine jump distances, style points and referee scores - just like in the real sport.
                    Your performance will be influenced by wind and your chosen equipment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The goal of the Ski jumping board game is to place in the best-possible position at individual events and become the overall Competition champion.
