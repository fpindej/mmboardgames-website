    EN: `Ski jumping is considered the crown discipline of winter sports. This game is dedicated to all of its fans and passionate followers. 
    Emotion, thrills, joy and good times await; just as if you were at a real competition. While playing, you will start training both the physical and mental strength of your jumper. Conserving your jumperâ€™s energy is an important factor in the contest. And, of course, you will get to jump from ski ramps with a realistic-looking figure. Players determine jump distances, style points and referee scores - just like in the real sport. Your performance will be influenced by wind and your chosen equipment.   
    
    The goal of the Ski jumping board game is to place in the best-possible position at individual events and become the overall Competition champion.
